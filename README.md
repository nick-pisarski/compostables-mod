# Compostables Mod

## Description

A Factorio mod that introduces composting mechanics to the game. This mod allows players to create compost from organic materials, which can then be used to produce landfill through natural spoilage.

## Features

### New Items
- **Wood Chips**: Created by processing wood (1 wood â†’ 10 wood chips)
- **Compost**: A bulk material that spoils into landfill over time

### Composting Recipes
The mod provides two different ways to create compost:

1. **Spoilage Composting**: Combine 50 spoilage with 100 water to create 50 compost
2. **Wood Chips Composting**: Combine 100 wood chips with 100 water to create 50 compost

### Spoilage Mechanics
- Compost has a stack size of 100
- Compost automatically spoils into landfill after 600 ticks (10 seconds at 60 UPS)
- This provides a renewable source of landfill for base building

## Technical Details

- **Mod Version**: 0.1.0
- **Factorio Version**: 2.0+
- **Dependencies**: Base game 2.0 or higher
- **Author**: RR
- **Spoiling Required**: Yes (enables the spoilage mechanics)

## Installation

1. Download the mod files
2. Place the `compostables` folder in your Factorio mods directory
3. Enable the mod in Factorio's mod menu
4. Start a new game or load an existing save

## Usage

1. **Create Wood Chips**: Use the crafting menu to convert wood into wood chips
2. **Make Compost**: Use either spoilage or wood chips with water to create compost
3. **Wait for Spoilage**: Let the compost sit in your inventory or storage to naturally convert to landfill
4. **Use Landfill**: The resulting landfill can be used for base expansion and construction

## Graphics

The mod includes custom graphics for:
- Wood chips icon (64x64 pixels)
- Compost icon (64x64 pixels)

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Factorio 2.0 and requires the base game. It should be compatible with most other mods that don't conflict with the wood, water, or landfill systems.

## To Do

- Create entities (Not sure what this is, maybe for when you drop the item or on the belt?)
- Update Images to look more like the real thing
